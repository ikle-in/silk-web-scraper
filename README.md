# Silk Web Scraper
## By Isaac Klein
### A simple web scraping java program.

This project was completed in June of 2020 for the purpose of learning more about Java desktop applications. After taking several Java programming courses in college, I was interested in trying to create a desktop application that remained quite simple while expanding my knowledge of Java and JavaFX GUI Design. One major goal for this project was to allow the user to save their preferences, with the program applying these settings each time it opened up.

The resulting application acts as a simple "web scraper" program - just enter a full webpage link and you can view the site's HTML, a list of all links found on the page, and more.
